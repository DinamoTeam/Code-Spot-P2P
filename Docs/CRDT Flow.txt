// Ê từ giờ insert / remove thì luôn luôn là 'range' insert / remove nhé. bỏ chữ range đi cho ngắn
1.	4 Important files:
	- code.editor.component.ts
	- editor.service.ts
	- peer.service.ts
	- PeerMessagesTracker.ts
	
2.	Flow
	2.1	Local + Remote Insert:
		- User 1 inserts
			-> codeEditor.onDidChangeModelContentHandler()
				-> editorService.handleLocalInsert()
					-> peerService.broadcastInsert() (Remember to setTimeOut for ackOrResend)
		- User 2 3 4 receive remote insert
			-> peerService.on('data', MessageType="Remote Insert")
				-> send Ack
				-> peerService.handleRemoteInsert() *
					-> peerMessagesTracker.receiveRemoteInserts(CRDT[]): void // update newestMessages arr, hasNotReceived arr, deleteBuffer arr
					-> emit event to code-editor.component, code-editor.component calls editorService.handleRemoteInsert()
					-> peerMessagesTracker.processDeleteBuffer(): void // Delete 'ready' characters
	
	2.2 Local + Remote Remove: 
		- Similar to above
		- Differences:
				-> peerService.handleRemoteRemove() *
					-> peerMessagesTracker.receiveRemoteRemoves(CRDT[]): void
					-> editorService.handleRemoteRemove(CRDT[])
					// No need to processDeleteBuffer
					
	2.3	Join room:
		2.3.1 Join new room:
			- U1 gets PeerId from PeerServer. It then creates new room in C# Db and get its SiteId from Db

		2.3.2 Join existing room:
			- U4 gets PeerId from PeerServer and go to C# Db to get U4's SiteId and PeerId of other people in Room
			- U4 pick a random User, let's say U2, and getOldMessages from U2
			- After done getting old messages (acknowledge blabla), U4 connects with the rest in room
			
3.	Some new files:
	3.1	peer.service.ts: 
		- Similar to RapidChat
	
	// Note: Remember the difference between SiteId(1,2,3,4,...) from C#, and PeerId(1y5-31dfs-sas6-efw1) from PeerServer
	3.2	PeerMessagesTracker.ts: 
		- We need it because the orders of messages sent are not preserved in UDP protocol.
		class PeerMessagesTracker {
			private newestMessages: array of {SiteId: number, newestMessageClock: number}
			private hasNotReceived: array of {SiteId: number, hasNotReceivedMessages: number[]}
			private deleteBuffer: array of {SiteId: string, crdtNotReceivedButIsRequestedToBeDeleted: CRDT[]}
			
			<<1,2><3,4>5>a
			// NOTE: SiteId (1,2,3,4,...) of ANY CRDT object can be found at crdt.lastIndentifier.id. This is the person who created that character
			
			receiveRemoteInserts(crdts: CRDT[]): void {} // update newestMessage for each site, update hasNotReceived, 
																			see which CRDTs in deleteBuffer are ready to be deleted
			
			processDeleteBuffer(): void {} // editorService.handleRemoteRemove(readyToBeDeletedCRDT)
			
			receiveRemoteRemoves(crdts: CRDT[]): void {} // See which CRDT hasn't been received yet, add them to deleteBuffer
		
		}
					
	3.3	AcknowledgementCenter.ts (Later)
		- Handle ack and resend. 
					
					
SUGGESTED NEW FLOW: local changes -> catch event in code-editor.component.ts -> call editor service -> editor service broadcast this event -> peer service broadcase to other ppl

remote changes -> peer service catch it -> code-editor component subscribe to it -> call handle remote range insert. Here we use message tracker blah blah -> decided whether to insert to BST or not AND whether to render or not
