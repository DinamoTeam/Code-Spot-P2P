0. Goals
	- Enable fast insert / delete even if user paste / delete 10k characters
	- Make syncing works for all cases (insert, remove, replace a chunk of text and code suggestion)

I.	Flow (integrated generateNPositionsBetween and BalancedBST):
	
	1	Editor.service.ts
		- handleLocalRangeInsert(editorTextModel: any, chArr: string[], startIndex: number, roomName: string): void {}
			+ Generate N CRDT objects using generateNPositionsBetween, insert them to BalancedBST and then broadcast them to the server
			
		- handleLocalRangeRemove(editorTextModel: any, startIndex: number, length: number, roomName: string): void {}
			+ Remove N CRDT objects from BalancedBST, add these N objects to a list and broadcast that list to the server
			
		- handleRemoteRangeRemove(editorTextModel: any, crdtStrs: string[]): void {}
			+ Remove each CRDT object from the BalancedBST, return a list of {index, char} to be reflected on Monaco
			+ NOTE: Some EDGE CASES will break the program if on Monaco, we take a shortcut and delete text from list[0].index to list[length-1].index
			+ Worst case senerio, we will need to delete individual character one by one on Monaco. This will not happen though. 
				We can loop through list for consecutive ranges and delete them
				
		- handleRemoteRangeInsert(editorTextModel: any, crdtStrs: string[]): void {}
			+ Insert each CRDT object to the BalancedBST, return a list of {index, char} to be reflected on Monaco
			+ Same NOTE with handleRemoteRangeRemove
			
	2	MessageHub.cs
		- ExecuteRangeInsert(List<string> crdtStrs, string roomName)
			+ Add each crdtStr to database and then send RemoteRangeInsert request to otherClientsInGroup
		
		- ExecuteRangeRemove(List<string> crdtStrs, string roomName)
			+ Delete each crdtStr from database and send RemoteRangeRemove request to otherClientsInGroup
		
		NOTE:  Optimize insert to / delete from database by executing SaveChangesAsync AFTER we have inserted / deleted ALL crdtStrs

	// Ê trong message content ko cần seperate CRDT by ~ nữa, dùng 1 cái list là xong right? List<string> crdtStrs ý?

II/ TODO LIST:

1.	Editor side:
	- Write 4 functions in Part I
	- Use these 4 functions to sync when
		+ insert text 
		+ delete text
		+ replace a chunk of text (replace = remove and then insert)
		+ code suggestion
		+ Select text and move it by mouse. We need to either hand this case or disable this feature
	- Get AllMessages: When User1 just inserted 1000 characters, User2 enters the room, User2 gets error -> fix that (Maybe not, we will change to P2P anyway)
	- User1 is typing lots of text. User2 move cursor to where User1 is typing -> User2's text is selected -> Fix that

2.	Server side:
	- Write 2 functions in Part I
	- Delete Room's data database when all users have disconnected
	
3.	Other stuff (Not too important for now):
	- Optimize generateLessThan() for shorter CRDTId
	- Peer to Peer 
	- Handle the case where User's wifi goes down
	- Database key: chuyển thành AutoIncrement ID, (CRDTObject, RoomName) is unique
	
*** IMPORTANT: Make sure Minh understands:
- How to delete a range of text and insert a range of text on Monaco
	+ Dùng executeInsert để insert cả 1 đoạn text right?
	+ Dùng deleteTextInRange để delete cả 1 đoạn text right?
- Ngoài EditorTextModel, tao còn thấy Editor. 2 cái đấy khác nhau như nào?
+ 

- Branch: git branch abc 
git checkout abc


1.	Việc của Giang:
	- Fix messagesDTO
	- Auto suggestion

2. Việc của Minh:
	- Insert Range, Remove Range
	- Nối các function bên Editor và Server lại với nhau
