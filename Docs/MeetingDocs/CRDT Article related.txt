Article outline:
- Insert code vào đâu cho hợp lý

Article 1: Building a real-time synchorized code editor (Part 1)
- Overview (1 para): (Tell a story style) Why we decided to do Code Spot. Our successful end result: what have we achieved at the end. Ask ppl to check it out. End para with: In this article, we will show you guy the key underlying ideas on building a real-time synchorized code editor.
- Why building a synchronize real time editing is difficult
    -> Phần 1+2: 2 problem. Có câu chốt conclusion
- How CRDT can help solve those problems
    Intro para: add unique id + abc. We'll see this in an Examples
    -> Example 1
    ...
    -> Example 2
- Full examples of CRDT and how it solve the 2 problems
- Conclusion: In this article, we've learned about abc. In the next article, we'll talk more about abcd.
Comment below if you have questions + what you want to hear more

Article 2: Building a real-time synchorized code editor (Part 2)
- This article is about how to generateNpositionBetween -> focus the entire article on this

Article 3 (Optional): Building a real-time synchorized code editor (Part 3)
This article will be about #3 challenges that we faced and our solution
- Mình sẽ làm kiểu 3 cái header: xong mỗi cái là 1-2 para.
- Có thể nói về challenges như kiểu how to connect users together, sync cursor, etc
- But point là mỗi idea chỉ nói 1-2 para về WHAT was the prob, and HOW we solve it

+ P2P: Mình set up connection kiểu ông mặt trời 3 paragraph
        . UDP protocol
+ Optimization: BST, Custom number (Hiện tại đang dùng base 10): 1 paragraph
+ Sync cursor, selection: 1 paragraph
